In hisÂ paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), Alan Turing explores the question "Can machines think?" by proposing the Imitation Game, which has since become known as the Turing Test. Turing's approach changes the focus from defining intelligence to determining whether a machine can accurately mimic human behavior. His argument raises doubt on accepted theories of consciousness and presents the possibility that computers may possess intellect in alongside humans. In addition to providing the groundwork for contemporary computers, Turing's vision anticipated the development of artificial intelligence and raised moral and philosophical issues that are still relevant in discussions about the technology today.
